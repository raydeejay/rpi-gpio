* About rpi-gpio
  This is a very simple library to interact with the Raspberry Pi's
  GPIO ports, by means (so far) of the sysfs interface. While this is
  not the most efficient approach, it has the advantages of not
  requiring any external library, and not needing to know any memory
  addresses.

  Tested with SBCL 1.3.9 on Raspbian Jessie, on a Pi2.

  *NOTE:* The sysfs interface, as configured in Raspbian Jessie, uses
  BCM numbering.

* Why?
  Because I needed something like this, and I went for the most
  straighforward approach.

* Usage
  The included /demo.lisp/ shows an example of the intended usage.

* To do
  - Unimportant things like check for errors... :D
  - Generalise it to other GPIOs, since it seems that the sysfs
    interface is generic.
  - Additional ways of accessing the GPIO ports.
  - Tests?
